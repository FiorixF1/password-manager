# Password Manager

A simple software to store your passwords in a safe place. You don't need to remember dozens of passwords anymore: just remember a single password to rule them all!

This program is written in Java and it is accessible through an interactive command-line interface. You can use it to store different kinds of sensitive data: not only passwords for online services, but also data of credit cards, private keys of Bitcoin wallets and simple access codes, such as the PIN of your SIM.
